## Local Development

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app, both the client and server, in the development mode.\
This is needed if you want to test out the Stripe Payment integrated in the project.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To start only the client, open the client folder in the project directory. You can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the frontend app without the backend server. 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Production Build

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can run the build on your local machine before deploying with `serve`

### `serve build`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
